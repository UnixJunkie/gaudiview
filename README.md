# GaudiView #

Light interface to explore solutions from GAUDIasm and others, inside UCSF Chimera

## Usage

1. Open up Chimera and launch `GAUDI> GaudiView`.
2. Select a YAML-formatted `*.gaudi` file, as generated by GAUDI. It will also display GOLD results if you choose the corresponding `gold.conf` file.
3. Click on the solutions you want to view. `Ctrl` and `shift` click will handle multiple selections. You can also navigate with up and down arrows.
4. The list can be multisorted and filtered. Feel free to experiment.
5. Double-click updates rotamers and mutamers in the protein, if available.
6. If you want to perform some actions on every pose, write a Chimera command and it will be executed every time the selection changes.
